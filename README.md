# Zoom Hue

Automatically turn on a philips hue light when you're on a zoom call.

I've created this repo for personal use.

## Getting started

```
mkdir .private
cp ./config.example.js ./.private/config.js
yarn install
```

Update the config file with your Phillips Hue information. More information on generating credentials [here](https://developers.meethue.com/develop/get-started-2/).

```
yarn run start
```
